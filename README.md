Key Features

Tech Stack

✅ Use Cases:

A simple news website for reading latest headlines.

Can be extended with search, filters, or category selection.

Useful for practicing React, API integration, and responsive web design.

If you want, I can also write a 1-paragraph “About” suitable for your GitHub or portfolio website — short, clear, and professional.

Do you want me to do that?
